                <p class="mb-16">The Sheba Gold Capital website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize sheba.gold pages, or register with the sheba.gold site or services, a cookie helps sheba.gold to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the same sheba.gold website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the sheba.gold features that you customized.</p>
